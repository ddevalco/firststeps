# FirstSteps

The code shared here is basic examples for network engineers starting out with Python scripting and trying to automate various aspects of a their network. Focus will be on Cisco networks, with an emphasis on NX-OS and IOS.

Key Python modules you will want to ensure you have installed will be "Netmiko" and "CiscoConfParse".

pip install netmiko
pip install ciscoconfparse

I will share some basic code samples within subdirectories here as it relates to posts on my site:
